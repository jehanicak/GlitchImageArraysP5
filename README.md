## Weekly Assignment 3 

### Jake Hanicak / 2-20-20 / Glitch Arrays

##### For this project I have created a stste machiene that goes through 6 different states! Each of these states has an image, and cooresponding effects for each picture. 

##### to get this project to run you must open terminal and type in the following commands: 

#### - cd 'name of file in the directory'
##### - python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

##### This creates the local host and allows you to run your program

###### From then on you can get to each different state utalizing the keys 0-5... and on each different stste you can mess with the keys and the mouse to trigger different effects in the background
